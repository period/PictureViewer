    <h1>Welcome to pics.thomas.gg!</h1>
    <p>This is my corner of the internet where I keep all of my photos of aircraft in the sky and on the ground. All photos are organised by their registration, which allows for additional metadata to be attached.</p>
    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>Most of the additional metadata relating to an aircraft is pulled from <a href="https://www.opensky-network.org">The OpenSky Network</a>.</p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>I can be reached by email by replacing the first '.' of this site's address with an @.</p>
    <h3>A word on copyright</h3>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated, all photos are owned by myself. Please don't use my photos elsewhere without my permission!</p>
